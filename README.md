### Work Experience
Data Solutions Engineer @ PricewaterhouseCoopers Ltd
- Real-Time Streaming Data Platform
  
**Project Vision:** To build a data platform as a web-app, integrated with the company's ERP and databases, that can handle large volumes of structured and semi-structured data in real time, transform it into accounting double entries and post it into the ERP accordingly. All operations and records must also be stored and maintained effectively and efficiently in the data warehouse. Clickstream data must also be analyzed in real time to provide insights that will assist the continuous improvement/continuous development effort. For data security and monitoring best practises, data anomalies must be detected in real-time and the relevant teams must be notified immediately.

**My role:** As the development lead, I had the opportunity to be included in all stages of the project's lifecycle. From gathering and documenting requirements from all stakeholders during the business analysis sessions, to building prototype ETL pipelines that collect and transform data according to accounting & business requirements in real time from various sources, to delivery of the final product, including unit testing, QA testing, end-user training sessions and incorporation of improvements collected from various stakeholders' feedback during the ongoing CI/CD cycle.

**Outcome:** This platform is to date the most used data solution within the company, enabling staff to process far bigger amounts of transactions than they could before, in a tiny fraction of the time, with a much higher accuracy. Human errors were elimited by 98% and the newly achieved efficiencies allowed the company to take on a much higher amount of work with the same amount of staff, significantly increasing profits. The project's success underscored the need for further funding of my team, and we grew from 3 people to over 20 in the span of a couple of years. As the most senior member in the team after my Senior Project Manager, I was responsible for personally mentoring and onboarding every new team member.
